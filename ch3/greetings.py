# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the
# person’s name

names = ['frank', 'rachuonyo', 'olwenda']

print("Hi " + names[0].title() + " how are you today?")
print("Is it true that " + names[1].title() + " is a place?")
print("I understand that " + '"' +names[2].title() + '"' + " is a very uncommon name" )
